# P-2-P File Sharing System

A simple file sharing system implemented using file handling principles in **Python** that can handle complex file transfers of any type (.docx, .pdf, .mp3, .mp4, .exe, .png, .jpeg, jpg and any program files to name a few) across **different clients from a single server** at any single point of time via a shared Wi-fi connection or a hotspot. For simplicity and testing purposes, the UI has been designed by python's own GUI module called **tkinter** which helps in easier design choices and simple interfaces for the user.

## Usage

Download the server and the client .py files from the repository and run it on your local system. The server and the client can be on different devices also, ensuring the proper file transfers between two different machines. 

Few things to note before running:

- Keep the port number as default (8080). You can change it only if you are sure about the changes.
- Have a proper wi-fi or hotspot connection for both the devices before running the programs.
